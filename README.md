# Codes of all Smart Interviews problems

Hey all, 
I am Hemanth Kumar Reddy Tatagari.

This repository contains codes of almost all Smart Interviews course problems. I was part of SmartInterviews programme from Jan-July 2023. And also aced the course 
standing at the top position. I was the leading scorer of the batch, first place in both internal contest 1 and 2, and second in IC3 , that too with 100% of attendance.
And also solved most number of problems on LeetCode. I have succesfully completed the Smart Coder course on 04 July,2023, and was gifted with a hoodie and a sipper from 
Smart Interviews. 

It was a great journey all along, and many thanks to JaswanthChelemila sir (@ SI developer cum instructor) who trained us to master the Data Structures, Algorthims and
Problem Solving. Special thanks to GPCET managment for providing with the chance and all facilities to learn from such instructors.
